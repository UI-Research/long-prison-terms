	<p>Replacing a handful of sentences from the previous example with 10 year sentences, we see how these long sentences lead to a stacking up effect.
	</p>
	<p>The line chart could/should show a "ghost" of the previous step(s), so it's easier to compare the two trends</p>
	<p>Colors can be used to double encode sentence length (first encoding is speed, second encoding could be color). In these sketches, yelow dots are sentences less than or equal to 10 years</p>
