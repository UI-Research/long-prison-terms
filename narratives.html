            <p>Home now, Stanley Mitchell often asks about old friends he hasn&rsquo;t seen in a while, only to be reminded that they died while he was in prison. But those 35 years behind bars felt separate from the real world, he said, and so those losses&mdash;once intangible and distant&mdash;are now taking their toll.
            </p>
            <p>&ldquo;In 35 years, can you imagine the relatives that I&rsquo;ve lost?&rdquo; Mitchell said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not real. What&rsquo;s real is that you&rsquo;re confined to a cell at night. The other stuff is out there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p id="sidebar1">Even after his wife died, Mitchell said he couldn&rsquo;t mourn because he had to stay alert in prison. He couldn&rsquo;t afford to walk around in a daze. He had seen others succumb to depression, addiction, and violence, and he was determined not to lose himself to grief.</p>

            <p>Being in prison for 20, 30, or 40 years means that loss is inevitable. Elvin Garcia lost his younger brother while in prison. Nelson Rivera lost his mom. Ramona Brant watched as her children were raised by strangers after her parents died.</p>
            <p>And when those incarcerated for a long time are released, they&rsquo;re sent back into a world that seems foreign and strange in small ways and insurmountable in big ones. Cell phones are ubiquitous. Parking meters have changed. Subway tokens are a thing of the past. But those changes pale in comparison to the challenges of finding a job, reconnecting with now-grown children, and trying to reconcile with so much lost time.</p>

              Surviving prison
            </div>
            <p>Prison stays aren&rsquo;t meant to be easy, but long stays that span decades or that have no end date in sight can exact devastating costs.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;When you don&rsquo;t have no hope and you think this is just going to be it for you, it obviously affects you mentally and, in some cases, physically,&rdquo; Mitchell said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen individuals stop taking care of theirself, and they develop all kinds of crazy diseases, diabetic, high blood pressure. And after a while, they just die. A lot of people that have life sentences die before they make parole.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>When Monica Jahner first saw the prison where she would be housed, she thought it looked like a college campus. She was 22 and had been sentenced to life. The reality of her situation&mdash;and the fear&mdash;didn&rsquo;t set in, she said, until she was put in solitary confinement (the only space available) and the door shut behind her.  </p>

            <p>&ldquo;The fear of what was going to happen to you day to day based on who didn't like you and who did and not having any options in making my own choices was traumatizing for me,&rdquo; Jahner said. &ldquo;That was the hardest part of doing time.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>The constant stress gave her ulcers, high blood pressure, and tachycardia. Jahner said she had to be rushed to the hospital regularly when her heart would beat dangerously fast.</p>

            <p>In 1995, <a href="http://fusion.net/how-a-first-time-drug-charge-became-a-life-sentence-for-1793853465" target="_blank">Ramona Brant was sentenced to life without parole</a> for a drug conspiracy change&mdash;her first offense&mdash;when her two sons were ages 3 and 4. Their father received the same sentence, leaving the boys with Brant&rsquo;s parents.</p>
            <p>Brant&rsquo;s life sentence was a penalty, required by law, that even the sentencing judge said was too severe. When Brant first heard the sentence, she refused it. She left it behind in the courtroom and would not carry it with her. She assured her boys that she would be home again, and she was right&mdash;but it would take 21 years and a pardon from the president. And, by that time, her boys were no longer boys.</p>

            <p>From prison, Brant tried to stay connected to her kids. She sent money home from her commissary job to pay for their haircuts. At the start of every school year, she wrote to her sons&rsquo; teachers, asking them to understand the situation her kids were in, with both parents in prison.  </p>
            <p>&ldquo;They were just suffering. &hellip;They didn&rsquo;t have their parents to come to PTA. They didn&rsquo;t have their parents to drop them off in the morning and pick them up at night. They didn&rsquo;t have their parents to come and have lunch with them at school and show their parents off. They didn&rsquo;t have that,&rdquo; Brant said. &ldquo;[I] just wanted [the teachers] to understand I'm absent&hellip;physically, but I&rsquo;m there if you allow me to be there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Brant&rsquo;s father died five years after she went to prison. Another five years later, her mom passed away and the children went to a group home. A man working at the group home later took the boys in through foster care, a kindness that Brant remains grateful for. But the time with her kids that she missed out on continues to haunt her.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;My arms would ache from not being able to pick them up and hold them. &hellip;I didn&rsquo;t have children until late, and so I was excited to have these little mes, these mines&hellip;to give birth and to hold my child for the first time and protect them as best as I could,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then I woke up one day and I was stripped of all of that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I missed out on their first day of school. &hellip;I missed out on being able to encourage them to persevere. I missed out on being a mother&mdash;period. I feel like I was robbed of that opportunity because they were babies. And when I came home, they had babies. &hellip;It&rsquo;s even hard now to know that I can never get those days back.&rdquo;</p>

              Life after prison
            </div>
            <p>It&rsquo;s been over two years since Ramona Brant was granted clemency. Supporters and <a href="http://www.vibe.com/2016/02/ramona-brant-freed-prison-21-years-obama-clemency/">news cameras</a> greeted her outside the prison gates when she was released. But after the celebration, she struggled adjusting to life outside. </p>
            <p>Brant moved to a halfway house in Charlotte, North Carolina. She&rsquo;d spend hours downtown just sitting on a bench, fascinated by people walking by with their eyes glued to their cell phones.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Everything surprised me,&rdquo; Brant said. &ldquo;Everything was new. Everything was different. Flat-screen TVs. Laptops. Going to the bank with a card. Trying to ride the train. Filling out paperless applications. Going to the grocery store and scanning my own food, checking my own self out. Getting in a car and watching it have a camera to see how you're backing up. Everything. I felt like I just landed here and I had to learn everything all over again.&rdquo;</p>
            <p id="sidebar13">But her surprise and curiosity were often overwhelmed by the fear that she would be sent back to prison for the smallest infractions, like getting back to the halfway house past her curfew or not knowing she needed a ticket instead of a token for the train.</p>

            <p>Returning home after decades in prison often means starting over at an age when most people are already established in life. It can mean looking for a job in your fifties with no work experience and the stigma of a criminal record. It can mean not having stable housing or a support system because you&rsquo;ve outlived your parents or lost your partner.
