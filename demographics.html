            <p>Black people are incarcerated at a rate <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Color-of-Justice-Racial-and-Ethnic-Disparity-in-State-Prisons.pdf" target="_blank">over five times that of white people</a> nationwide (and significantly higher in many states). Other racial and ethnic groups face disparities in imprisonment, but major data gaps make it difficult to measure the extent of these disparities. These same gaps prevented us from looking at the full picture of racial and ethnic inequalities in long prison terms.
            </p>
            <p>The black incarceration rate has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/10/almost-nobody-is-paying-attention-to-this-massive-change-in-criminal-justice/?utm_term=.aa759f7ab0c1" target="_blank">decreased</a> over the past decade, likely as a result of reforms for less serious drug offenses. But people serving the longest terms remain untouched by such policy changes.</p>
            <p>In 35 of the 44 states <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=268" target="blank">with complete data</a>, racial disparities among people serving the longest terms are larger than disparities in the overall prison population. In Pennsylvania, for example, black people make up 49 percent of the state prison population but 60 percent of those serving the longest prison terms. </p>

            <p>Though most states have seen a decline in racial disparities among people serving shorter prison terms, the story is less consistent among those in prison the longest. In recent years, racial disparities have decreased in at least 42 states for people serving less than 10 years. But in at least 19 states, disparities actually grew among people serving 10 or more years. Current reforms fail to address these glaring disparities because they largely leave out those serving the longest terms.</p>

            <p>Women in prison are a <a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/facts-about-over-incarceration-women-united-states?redirect=facts-about-over-incarceration-women-united-states" target="_blank">rapidly growing group</a>—and in most states, a growing share have served more than 10 years. In Michigan, 8 percent of women in prison had served at least a decade as of 2000; by 2013, that number was 13 percent. In Wisconsin, this figure rose from 1.8 to 6.5 percent over the same period. Across the 44 states we looked at, over 5,500 women had been in prison for at least 10 years.</p>
            <p>Overall, women are most likely to be sent to prison for a property or drug conviction than a violent conviction. In the most recent year of data available, only 37 percent of women in prison had a violent conviction, compared with 55 percent of men. But among people serving the longest terms, a full 92 percent of women had been convicted of a violent offense, roughly on par with men (91 percent).</p>

            <p>Because they are a relatively small group, little is known about women serving long prison terms. But ample research shows that women’s experiences before, during, and after prison often differ greatly from those of men. Incarcerated women are <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/parip.pdf" target="_blank">much more likely</a> to have experienced abuse before entering prison, and those serving life sentences have reported some of the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08974454.2010.512229" target="_blank">highest rates of prior abuse</a>.</p>
            <p>Some women serving long sentences for drug offenses may have been charged as accomplices in drug conspiracies because of their <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=429281&" target="_blank">relationships with men</a> engaged in criminal activity. In some sentencing schemes, especially at the federal level, women may be held equally accountable for crimes committed by their partners despite having little or no intentional involvement.</p>

            <p>As the number of women serving long prison terms continues to grow, more research is needed to understand how they are uniquely affected by incarceration.</p>

            <p>More than 30 percent of people who have spent the most time in prison are at least 55 years old, compared with just over 10 percent of the overall prison population.</p>
            <p>More people serving longer prison terms means that more people are growing old in prison. Between 1993 and 2013, the share of people 55 or older <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/aspp9313.pdf" target="_blank">in state prisons increased by 400 percent</a>. This was caused in part by an influx of older people, but it also reflects a greater proportion of people serving longer prison terms.</p>
            <p>Prisons are typically ill-equipped to address the needs of the elderly and disabled, and prison staff may not be prepared to treat age-related conditions. Many of the stresses of prison, such as victimization, discipline, and poor conditions, are <a href="https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/usprisons0112webwcover_0.pdf" target="_blank">even harder</a> on older people.</p>

            <p>Health care in prison is also extremely expensive, and people require more support as they grow older. The <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/elderlyprisonreport_20120613_1.pdf" target="_blank">annual cost</a> of incarcerating someone over age 50 is twice the cost for the average person.</p>

Keeping elderly people in prison, especially after they have lost their physical or mental capacities, serves no practical purpose—as demonstrated by the extremely <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2780859?seq=1" target="_blank">low rates of recidivism</a> among older people who are eventually released.</p>

              Reform efforts must consider those who are most affected by long prison terms.
            </div>
            <p class="conclusion-text">Shortening long prison terms won’t be enough to fix the criminal justice system. Reforms must increase racial and ethnic equity, not aggravate disparities. Women and their experiences must be included in policy conversations. Policymakers will need to reconsider whether it is sensible or fair to condemn people in their teens or early twenties to long sentences or to hold people in prison well into old age. To fully address these issues, we must take a hard look at the systemic inequalities driving these patterns.</p>
