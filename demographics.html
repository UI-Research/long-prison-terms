            Racial disparities in prisons are starkest among those serving the longest term.
            </div>
            <p>Black people are incarcerated at a rate over five times that of white people nationwide (and 
            significantly more, in many states). Though other racial and ethnic groups face disparities in 
            imprisonment, major data gaps almost certainly underestimate the problem. These same gaps 
            prevented us looking at the full picture of racial and ethnic inequalities in long prison terms. For this reason, we’ve focused on black-white disparity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Over the past decade, the black incarceration rate has been decreasing, likely as a result of reforms for less serious drug offenses. But those serving the longest terms remain untouched by such policy changes.</p>
            <br />

            <p>In 35 of the 44 states with complete data, racial disparities among those serving the longest prison terms are even larger than in the overall prison population. For example, nearly half of Pennsylvania’s prison population is black, but among those serving the longest terms, 60 percent are black.</p>
            <div class="graph-container">
            </div>
            <div class="graph-container">
            </div>
            <p> While most states have seen a decline in racial disparity among people with shorter prison terms, the story is less consistent among those in prison the longest. In recent years, racial disparity has decreased in at least 42 states for people serving less than 10 years. But in at least 11 states, this disparity actually grew for people serving 10 or more years. Current reforms fail to address these glaring disparities because they largely leave out those serving the longest terms.</p>
            <div class="left-col-header"><!--HEADLINE 2-->
              Nearly 2 in 5 people serving the longest prison terms were incarcerated before age 25. 
            </div>
            <p>Many people in the 10 percent of the prison population serving the longest terms were sentenced for crimes committed in their youth. Some have been incarcerated for more than half their lives. In California, this is true for more than 5,500 people; in Florida, it’s nearly 3,000.</p>
            <div id="headline2-image">
            </div>
            <p>Recent Supreme Court cases have upheld that youth under 18 are fundamentally different from adults—that because their brains have not fully developed, they have a diminished capacity for self-control and responsible decisionmaking—and so cannot be sentenced to death or mandatory life without parole. These rulings offer new hope for many of the approximately 2,500 people sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed under the age of 18.</p>
            <p>Although youth ages 18 to 24 are considered adults in the eyes of the law, a growing body of scientific research shows that people’s brains are likely still developing well into their 20s. This means that 18- to 24-year-olds are particularly amenable to change and likely to age out of their criminal behavior, but do not have the same protections as youth under 18.</p>
            <p>These young people are still given extremely long sentences, including life without the possibility of parole. And those with a chance at parole are often nonetheless blocked by parole boards that continue to judge them solely by their original offense even decades later.

            Race and age disparities combine with devastating results. 
            </div>
            <p><b>One in five people who have been in prison for 10 or more years are black men incarcerated before the age of 25.</b> The racial disparity within this long-serving group is even starker than the disparity among the general prison population, where 1 in 8 people are black men incarcerated as youth. This staggering disparity reflects and perpetuates social inequalities, keeping a disproportionate number of young black men in prison and out of their communities for long periods.

              A growing share of women in prison are serving long prison terms.
            </div>
            <p>Women in prison are a rapidly- growing group—and in most states, a growing share have served more than 10 years. In Mississippi, for instance, 8 percent of women in prison had served at least a decade as of 2000; by 2014, that number was 13 percent. In Wisconsin, this figure rose from 1.8 to 6.5 percent during the same time. Across the 44 states we looked at, over 5,500 women had been in prison for at least 10 years.</p>
            <p>Overall, women are most likely to be sent to prison for a property or drug conviction. In the most recent year of data available, only 37 percent of women in prison had a violent conviction, compared with 55 percent of men. But among people serving the longest prison terms, a full 92 percent of women had been convicted of a violent offense—on par with men (91 percent).</p>
            <p>Because they are a relatively small group, little is known about women who serve long prison terms. But ample research shows that women’s experiences before, during, and after prison often differ greatly from men’s. Incarcerated women are much likelier to have experienced abuse before entering prison, and women serving life sentences have reported some of the highest rates of prior abuse.</p>
             <p>Some women serving long sentences for drug offenses may have been charged as accomplices in drug conspiracies as a result of their relationships with men. In some sentencing schemes— especially at the federal level—women may be held equally accountable for crimes committed by their partners, despite having little or no intentional involvement.</p>
            <p>Women are also more susceptible to the challenges that come with being an incarcerated parent: as of 2010, 62 percent of women in state prison had children, compared with 51 percent of men.</p>
            <p>As the number of women serving long prison terms continues to grow, more research is needed to understand how they are uniquely affected by incarceration.</p>

              People who have been incarcerated the longest tend to be older than the
              average person in state prison.
            </div>
            <p>More than 1 in 3 people who have spent the most time in prison are at least 55 years old. This is true of just over 1 in 10 people in the overall prison population.</p>
            <p>More people serving longer prison terms also means that more people are growing old in prison. Between 1993 and 2013, the share of people age 55 or older in state prisons increased by 400 percent. While this was caused in part by an influx of older people admitted to prison, it also reflected a greater proportion of people serving longer prison terms.</p>
            <p>Prisons are typically ill-equipped to address the needs of the elderly and disabled, and prison staff may not be prepared to treat age-related conditions. Many of the stresses of prison—such as victimization, discipline, and poor conditions—are even harder on older people.</p>

            <p>Health care in prison is also extremely expensive, and elderly people require much more support than their younger peers. The annual cost of incarcerating someone over age 50 is at least twice the cost of incarcerating the average person in prison.</p>

            <p>Our aging prison population is one of the clearest signs of a prison system designed to punish people, rather than ensure public safety.

              Reform efforts must consider those who are most affected by long prison terms.
            </div>
            <p class="conclusion-text">Shortening long prison terms will not be enough to fix the criminal justice system. Reforms must increase racial and ethnic equity and not aggravate disparities. Work must be done to include women and their experiences in policy conversations. Policymakers will need to reconsider whether it is sensible or fair to condemn people in their teens or early twenties to long sentences or to hold people in prison well into old age. To fully address these issues, we must take a hard look at the systemic inequalities driving many of these patterns.</p>
