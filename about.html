              <p>We took a new approach to measuring how much time people spend in US prisons. How did we get these numbers?</p>
              <p>The most traditional measure of time served is the average length of prison terms for all people released in a year. A serious problem with this measure is that it only includes those people who have been released in that year. People serving shorter sentences are overrepresented by this measure whereas those serving longer prison terms, who have yet to be released, are not counted. This is a significant obstacle when studying the impact of long terms on prison population dynamics.</p>
              <p>Urban developed a different approach to measuring time served to more effectively account for people who serve long prison terms and have yet to be released. We looked at a snapshot of everyone in prison at the end of the year and calculated how many years each person still in prison had served. This allows us to capture trends in time served among people who have not yet been released from prison. For example, someone who entered prison in 1995 and will eventually serve 25 years would not be included in a release cohort until 2020. However, our measure would capture, in each year, the amount of time he or she had been incarcerated until that point (e.g., 10 years in 2005, 15 years in 2010, and so on). This approach allows us to measure, in real time, trends in how long everyone currently in prison, regardless of admission or release date, has spent thus far. It is important to note that our method does not measure the total length of time an individual will spend in prison. It only reflects how long each person has served up to that date</p>
              <p>To construct this measure, we use term record data from the <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=268" target="_blank">National Corrections Reporting Program(NCRP)</a>, available for 44 states and Washington, D.C. In order to classify prison terms into offense categories, we use the variable indicating the offense with the longest sentence, which we then group based on standard Bureau of Justice Statistics offense classifications. The NCRP presents serious data challenges, particularly around data on race and ethnicity. Thus, we are limited to constructing two groups in our analysis on this topic: Black (which includes all people identified as black based on the NCRP race variable) and All other (which includes people listed as being in other racial groups as well as people for whom the race variable is missing).  </p>
              <p>The range of years reported by each state to the NCRP varies greatly. In most of our analyses, we focus on the years 2000-2014, and include all years available for each state. In some analyses, we use the most recent year of data available in each state. For most states, this means data from 2014. However, in some states the most recent year is 2013 (IL, MI, NJ, OH, OR, and Washington, D.C.) and in two it is 2012 (MD and SD).  </p>
              <p>Our method underestimates time served in certain ways. For example, if someone spent time in a local jail before being transferred to a state prison, we do not consider this time in our analysis. Data quality and reporting on jail terms are not consistent across states, so we choose to focus on time spent in state prison. We eliminate term records with a total sentence length of less than one year in an effort to filter out jail terms that may be included in the NCRP (which can occur in states with unified jail/prison systems). In addition, due to data limitations, we are not able to accurately link parole revocation data to the original prison term. A person on parole could return to prison and be released multiple times, but our measure considers each individual stay in prison separately rather than summing up their cumulative time served.</p>
              <p>Throughout this feature, we often refer to people with the “longest” prison terms. By this, we mean people in the top decile by time served, or the 10th of the prison population that has been in prison the longest. The cutoff point (i.e., 90th percentile) that delineates who is in the top 10 percent varies significantly by state and year. In some analyses, we also focus on people serving 10 or more years as a measure that is standardized across states and years.  </p>
