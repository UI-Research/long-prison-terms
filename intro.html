          Now imagine that some of these people begin to stay longer&mdash;say, 10 or 20 years. At first, this doesn&rsquo;t have a large effect on the prison population. But over time, it does. <strong>When people stay longer, they start to stack up</strong>.

          <strong>And when more people start serving more time, the combined effect is huge</strong>. These trends are real&mdash;except they involve roughly 2.2 million people behind bars rather than the 40 or so people imprisoned in our fictional example. In the United States, more people have been going to prison and staying there longer, mostly because of “tough-on-crime” policies that swept the country in the 1980s and &rsquo;90s. The prison population boomed as <a target = "_blank" href = "/policies.html">sentences got longer and release policies got more restrictive.</a>

          <strong>Recent <a href = "https://apps.urban.org/features/reducing-mass-incarceration/" target = "_blank">efforts to reduce the number of people</a> who are sent to prison</strong> in the first place, like alternatives to incarceration for drug offenses, have <a href = "http://apps.urban.org/features/justice-reinvestment/" target = "_blank">helped stem the flow</a> in some states and prisons.

          <strong>Other reforms limit how long people can stay in prison</strong> for low-level crimes, but that also doesn&rsquo;t affect people with the longest prison terms.

          This is a problem. So, what can be done?
        </div>
        <p class="conclusion-text">To start, we looked at prison term trends <a href = "about.html" target = "_blank">in a new way</a> and found that the longest terms are getting longer, particularly for violent offenses. But how long is too long? What is long enough? And do longer prison terms really translate into justice, rehabilitation, and public safety?</p>
        <p class="conclusion-text bottom-p">
        Efforts to meaningfully reduce the prison population must consider these questions, which may mean rethinking how we treat people convicted of serious crimes.
