          Imagine if everyone in prison stayed for one year. <span class = "textAppear" id = "appear2-1"> If the rate of people going to prison stays roughly the same, then as new people enter, others leave—and the prison population stays fairly stable.</span>

          Now imagine if some of these people began to stay longer—say, five or 10 years.<span class = "textAppear" id = "appear3-1"> At first, this doesn’t make much of an impact on the prison population.</span><span class = "textAppear" id = "appear3-2"> But over time, it does.</span>

        <p>
          <span class = "textAppear" id = "appear4-1">These trends are real. In the United States, more people have been going to prison and staying for longer periods of time, largely due to “tough on crime” policies that swept the country in the 1980s and 90s. The prison population boomed as sentences got longer and release policies got more restrictive.</span>

          Recent efforts to reduce the number of people who are sent to prison in the first place, like alternatives to incarceration for drug offenses, have helped stem the flow in some states and prisons. <span class = "textAppear" id = "appear5-1">But this typically affects only the people who wouldn’t be in prison for very long anyway.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class = "textAppear" id = "appear5-2">Meanwhile, people who are given the longest sentences continue to enter prisons at a steady pace.</span>

          Other reforms limit the amount of time people can stay in prison for low-level crimes, but that also doesn’t affect people with the longest prison terms.

          This is a problem. So what can be done to solve it?
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, we looked at prison term trends over time in a new way and found that the longest terms are getting longer, particularly for violent offenses. But how long is too long? How long is long enough? And do these long prison terms translate into justice, rehabilitation, and public safety?
        </p>
        <p>
          Efforts to meaningfully reduce the size of the prison population must take those questions into consideration, which may mean rethinking the way we treat people convicted of serious crimes.</p>
