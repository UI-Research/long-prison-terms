          Now imagine that some of these people begin to stay longer—say, 10 or 20 years.

          At first, this doesn’t have much of an effect on the prison population.

          These trends are real—except they involve roughly 2.2 million people behind bars rather than the 40 or so people imprisoned in our fictional example. In the United States, more people have been going to prison and staying there longer, mostly because of “tough-on-crime” policies that swept the country in the 1980s and ’90s. The prison population boomed as <a target = "_blank" href = "/policies.html">sentences got longer and release policies got more restrictive.</a>

          Recent <a href = "https://apps.urban.org/features/reducing-mass-incarceration/" target = "_blank">efforts to reduce the number of people</a> who are sent to prison in the first place, like alternatives to incarceration for drug offenses, have <a href = "http://apps.urban.org/features/justice-reinvestment/" target = "_blank">helped stem the flow</a> in some states and prisons.
        </p>
        <p class = "textAppear" id = "appear5-1">
          But these efforts typically only affect people who wouldn’t be in prison for very long anyway.

          Other reforms limit how long people can stay in prison for low-level crimes, but that also doesn’t affect people with the longest prison terms.

          This is a problem. So, what can be done?
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, we looked at prison term trends <a href = "/about.html" target = "_blank">in a new way</a> and found that the longest terms are getting longer, particularly for violent offenses. But how long is too long? What is long enough? And do longer prison terms really translate into justice, rehabilitation, and public safety?
        </p>
        <p>
          Efforts to meaningfully reduce the prison population must consider these questions, which may mean rethinking how we treat people convicted of serious crimes.
