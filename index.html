        Imagine one dot moving across the box to the right represents a person's time in prison. The slower the dot, the longer the sentence.

        Imagine if everybody in prison stayed for one year. As new people enter, others are leaving. The population stays relatively stable.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        Now imagine if some of these people began to stay longer—say, five, ten, or twenty years. At first, this doesn’t make much of an impact on the prison population. But over time, it does. Even as other people cycle in and out, these people stay. And when people stay longer, they start to stack up. It doesn’t take many people with long prison terms to make a big impact over time.

      <section class="step">
        And if the admission rate is also increased, the combined impact is huge.

      <section class="step">
        Many efforts today to reduce the prison population have focused on sending fewer people to prison in the first place. In some states/prisons, this has helped stem the flow. But this typically affects only the people who wouldn’t be staying in prison for very long anyway.

      <section class="step">
        Other reforms limit the amount of time people can stay in prison for low-level crimes. These types of reforms don’t affect the people staying in prison the longest.
