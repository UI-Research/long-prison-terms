    <div class="title">On average, people are spending more time in prison</div>
      <p>
        These graphs represent a year-end snapshot of the average number of years that people in state prisons have been incarcerated. Many will go on to serve considerably more time.
      </p> 
      <p>
       Each state’s story is unique, but we found a consistent upward trend in the amount of time people spend in state prisons. Since 2000, the length of the average prison term has risen in all 44 states (including the District of Columbia) that reported complete data to the National Corrections Reporting Program. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        This trend suggests that most states are still feeling the effects of policy decisions from the 1980s and ‘90s designed to keep people in prison longer.
      </p>

    <section class = "step">
    <div class="title">The increase is sharpest among people convicted of violent offenses</div>
      <p>
        In most states, this trend is mostly—if not entirely—driven by an increase in time served for violent crimes. These changes have an outsized effect on the prison population because more than half the people in state prisons are serving time for violent offenses, and the majority of those with long prison terms.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Reforms tend to focus on low-level crimes. And though they have helped reduce prison terms for minor drug offenses, their narrow focus has intentionally excluded those remaining in prison the longest.
      </p> 
    </section>

    <section class = "step">
    <div class="title">The longest prison terms are getting longer</div>
      <p>
        We looked at the 10 percent of the prison population in each state serving the longest terms, a measure that reflects each state’s unique population and policy environment. In most states, we observed a sharper increase in the average time served by the top 10 percent relative to the rest of the prison population.
      </p> 
      <p>
        The average time served by this group, according to the most recent data available, ranged from 9.5 years in South Dakota to as high as 26.1 years in Massachusetts. In most states, the top 10 percent have spent an average of 15–25 years in prison.
      </p> 
      <p>
        For many states, this represents a staggering increase. In Michigan, for example, the average time served among the top 10 percent was just 10 years in 1989. In 2013, the top 10 percent had served 26 years—a 160 percent increase. California also saw its average among this group rise from 9.7 years to 24.9 between 1992 and 2014. In nearly half the states we looked at, the average time served by this group has risen by more than five years since 2000.
      </p> 
      <p>
        These steep increases suggest a national trend, but the variation across states points to the power of state-specific policies.
      </p>

    <section class = "step">
    <div class="title">A growing share of the prison population has served at least 10 years</div>
      <p>
        In 35 states, at least 1 in 10 people in prison—1 in 5 in California and Michigan—had been there for a decade or more, according to the most recent data available. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        In some states, especially those that have reformed sentencing for low-level offenses, this group may be growing because fewer people are serving the shortest terms. California’s Public Safety Realignment Act of 2011 sentenced thousands convicted of non-serious offenses to county jails and probation, radically shifting the makeup of its prisons toward people with more serious convictions.
      </p> 
      </section>

    <section class = "step">
    <div class="title">The number of people who have served at least 10 years is growing too</div>
      <p>
        The shifting makeup of state prison populations doesn’t tell the entire story. The absolute number of people serving 10 or more years has also increased. In at least 11 states, this number has more than doubled since 2000.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Tens of thousands of people nationwide are serving these long sentences—and many will stay much longer.
