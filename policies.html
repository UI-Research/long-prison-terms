            <p>At the same time, there was emerging concern that indeterminate sentencing systems, which gave judges and parole boards a great deal of discretion, were contributing to leniency and racially disparate outcomes. These forces paved the way for a wave of “tough on crime” policies that favored rigid, certain, and severe punishment. Capitalizing on the public’s growing fear of violent crime and on tensions caused by social change, policymakers campaigned on platforms that highlighted crime and public safety as a major political issue nationwide. In the 1980s and 90s, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle enacted policies that <span class="blue-text">swept more people into the criminal justice system</span> and <span class="blue-text">held them there longer</span>, despite <span class="blue-text">scarce evidence</span> that this would help control crime.
            </p>
            <p>The pursuit of increasingly punitive sentencing policies eclipsed other goals of the justice system, like proportionality and parsimony—in other words, that the punishment should fit the crime and should be no stricter than necessary. The modern era of sentencing may have been born from a desire for greater consistency and certainty, but it came to be defined mainly by its severity.</p>

                The strategy of trying to get crime prevention by locking people up for very long periods of time is not well-founded. It never was.

            <p>States enacted these punitive changes at the front and back ends of the criminal justice system. On the front end—when people first enter the system—policy changes made sentences longer for a variety of crimes. Many states adopted determinate sentencing schemes that established fixed penalties and left judges powerless to consider individual circumstances. Tougher punishments undermined the important goals of proportionality and parsimony in sentencing, allowing people to be punished severely for even low-level crimes.</p>
            <p> On the back end are release policies that affect people already in prison and how long they’ll stay. Many states increased the minimum amount of a sentence people must serve and removed or restricted release options, like parole. By erasing opportunities to earn an earlier release, these policies removed incentives for people to undergo the transformative personal growth that actually prevents reoffending.</p>

            <p>Policymakers pursued their tough-on-crime agenda by enacting laws—many still on the books today— that handed down long sentences for many offenses. Some states changed their laws to make offenses eligible for prison time that had previously been punished with community supervision. Others changed their sentencing thresholds to <span class="blue-text">lower the quantity of drugs</span> or the value of stolen property required to trigger longer sentences.</p>
            <p>Often, the sentences allowed under these new laws were disproportionately long compared with the severity of the crime. In some states, broad sentencing ranges put into effect for certain offenses give judges considerable freedom to hand out harsh punishments. In Utah, for instance, first-degree felonies carry a minimum sentence of 5 years—and a <span class="blue-text">maximum of life</span>. In Louisiana, the penalty for armed robbery can range <span class="blue-text">from 5 to 99 years</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="blue-text">Experts have suggested</span> that longer sentences became the norm for all types of offenses partly because of a growing acceptance of severe sentences for the most serious crimes. In our criminal justice system, these sentences have set a historically unprecedented standard of punishment that has normalized harsh penalties for all other offenses.

            Popular “bumper-sticker” crime policies drove up time served for certain types of crimes.
            </div>
            <p>Certain crimes or circumstances can automatically trigger mandatory sentence increases if, for example, an offense is gang-related or if it’s committed near a school. These rules can require judges to hand out longer sentences, even if they don’t think those sentences are warranted. Furthermore, these sentencing enhancements tended to disproportionately affect communities of color, exacerbating racial disparities.
            </p>
            <p>As crime and public safety became more of a kitchen-table issue, lawmakers promoted “tough on crime” policies directly to voters. They appealed to the public with  memorable slogans, like “Three strikes and you’re out,” “Seven deadly sins,” or “Truth in Sentencing.”</p>

              <p>Florida enacted a “10-20-Life” law in 1999 that triggered long mandatory sentences for people convicted of certain crimes involving a firearm. Simply displaying a gun could earn someone 10 years; firing it, even as a warning shot, could earn them 20. Judges were not allowed to make exceptions.</p>
              <p>Even though the number of new people sentenced every year under this enhancement stayed fairly steady, the number of people in prison serving 10-20-Life sentences skyrocketed because so few were released each year. As new people entered, this group continued to stack up.</p>
              <p>Although Florida policymakers recently reformed the 10-20-Life law to give judges more discretion in sentencing, about one in ten people still in Florida prisons today—nearly 11,000 people—was sentenced under this law.</p>

              <p>Though it was not the first state to adopt such a policy, California’s notorious Three Strikes law stands out as one of the most extreme. Enacted in 1994, the law doubled the penalty for a second felony if the first was violent, and it triggered a sentence of 25 years to life for any third felony—even petty theft.</p>
              <p>A 2012 ballot initiative (Proposition 36) reformed the law to prevent less serious crimes from triggering a third-strike life sentence and included a retroactivity clause that made more than 3,000 people in California prisons eligible to petition for reduced sentences. It did not, however, reform the law for people with more serious third-strike offenses, including some drug crimes— nor did it change the second-strike provision.</p>
              <p>Today, “second-strikers” continue to receive long sentences. Even while reforms to reduce overcrowding between 2006 and 2016 caused California’s total prison population to drop by 25 percent, the number of people in prison serving a second-strike sentence has held steady.</p>
              <p>These mandatory sentencing laws have caused a major shift in the make-up of California’s prison population. In 2006, one in five people had been sentenced under the two-strikes provision. Today, second-strikers make up a full quarter of the state’s prison population.</p>

            <p>California was not the only state to adopt these types of mandatory minimums. States like Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina also have extreme “Two Strikes” policies that require mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for certain second offenses.</p>

            <p>Historically, people in prison could get time off their sentences for maintaining clean disciplinary records or participating in programs. Parole boards traditionally weighed these factors and other signs of personal transformation when deciding who to release. These credits were integral to state sentencing structures. In fact, when judges made sentencing decisions, they took into account that people could earn time off.</p>
            <p>A wave of legislation in the 1980s and 90s, however, limited or eliminated these “good time” or “earned time” credits. Many states began to adopt determinate sentencing structures and “truth in sentencing” laws that required people to serve a set percentage of their minimum sentences, regardless of their behavior in prison. In states that embraced determinate sentencing, the amount of time people spent in prison was suddenly dictated at the moment of sentencing, leaving little flexibility to account for their personal growth over the years spent in prison. By the turn of the century, 41 states and the District of Columbia had adopted some form of truth in sentencing law.</p>

            <p>Stripped of the opportunity to work toward their own release, people serving long sentences were given little structural incentive to take part in programming, develop skills, or otherwise try to transform their lives. Instead of serving as centers of rehabilitation, prisons became warehouses where people served time with few opportunities to redeem themselves and little hope for the future.</p>

              <p>Michigan’s truth in sentencing law is one of the most extreme, requiring people to serve 100 percent of their minimum sentences in prison.

              <p>These changes drove up the time served by people who could otherwise have earned credits for good conduct. Michigan’s stringent release policies have helped make it one of the states with the longest average time served.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, by the turn of the century, 21 states had abolished or seriously restricted parole eligibility for many offenses. Parole boards, in the states where they were retained, became less likely to release people who had served their minimum sentences.

            <p>Even the opportunity to appear before a parole board for consideration became less likely. Statutory changes in some states extended the amount of time people had to wait for their next hearing after being denied parole. As the size and makeup of parole boards changed, so did the prospects for parole-eligible people to have their cases heard. Because most board members are selected by state governors and legislatures, the composition and behavior of a board can shift quickly based on political considerations, leading to marked changes in parole rates over time that have nothing to do with the people being considered for parole.</p>

              <p>In recent decades, the number of people paroled in Michigan each year has varied in response to political decisions about release policies and procedures. In 1992, the state overhauled the parole-granting system and changed the board makeup from civil servants to political appointees. In just five years, parole approvals dropped by 10 percent, and the number of people who stayed in prison longer than their court-imposed sentence nearly doubled.</p>
              <p>In 2009, Governor Jennifer Granholm signed an executive order expanding the parole board to increase its capacity to review cases that were being continually deferred. Within the year, the number of paroles granted skyrocketed. When the following governor Rick Snyder took office in 2011, he reinstated the former parole board.</p>

            <p>Parole policies and practices are often extremely reactive, responding quickly to incidents that grab the public’s attention. High-profile crimes committed by people on parole raise the perceived political stakes of granting parole to others. Risk-averse parole board members may simply prefer not to grant parole rather than take a chance that someone they release will reoffend.</p>

              <p>In some cases, though, states have avoided these consequences by taking a more measured response to such incidents.

            <p>The number of people serving life sentences has more than quadrupled since 1984, and it rose most sharply for those with no possibility of parole. As of 2016, one in every nine people in prison was serving a life sentence. When virtual life sentences—those that exceed a person’s likely lifespan—are included, that figure increases to one in seven.</p>
            <p>Before the 1970s, few served the entirety of a “life” sentence, and life without the possibility of parole existed in only seven states. Now, every state except Alaska has adopted it. Meanwhile, parole for life sentences has become much less likely. And, over the past few decades, more and more life sentences have been given to people convicted of crimes other than murder and even for nonviolent offenses.</p>
            <p>This rapid shift reflected a modern sentencing reality that favored indefinite imprisonment over rehabilitation. After the US Supreme Court temporarily banned the death penalty in 1972, the popularity of life without parole sentences exploded as states sought alternatives to capital punishment. Today, the United States remains one of only a few countries that issues sentences of life without parole.</p>
