            <p id="sidebar11">At the same time, there was emerging concern that indeterminate sentencing systems, which gave judges and parole boards a great deal of discretion, were contributing to leniency and racially disparate outcomes. These forces paved the way for a wave of &ldquo;tough-on-crime&rdquo; policies that favored rigid, certain, and severe punishment. Capitalizing on the public&rsquo;s growing fear of violent crime and on tensions caused by social change, policymakers campaigned on platforms that highlighted crime and public safety as a major political issue nationwide. In the 1980s and &rsquo;90s, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle enacted policies that <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p12tar9112.pdf" target="_blank">swept more people into the criminal justice system</a> and <a href="http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/reports/2012/06/06/time-served-the-high-cost-low-return-of-longer-prison-terms" target="_blank">held them there longer</a> despite <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/18613/chapter/5#89" target="_blank">scarce evidence</a> that this would help control crime.

            <p>The pursuit of increasingly harsh sentencing policies eclipsed other goals of the justice system, like proportionality and parsimony&mdash;in other words, that the punishment should fit the crime and should be no stricter than necessary. The modern era of sentencing may have been born of a desire for greater consistency and certainty, but it came to be defined by its severity.</p>

            <p>States enacted these punitive changes at the front and back ends of the criminal justice system. At the front end&mdash;when people first enter the system&mdash;policy changes made sentences longer for a variety of crimes. Many states adopted determinate sentencing schemes that established fixed penalties and left judges powerless to consider the circumstances of each case. Tougher sentences undermined the important goals of proportionality and parsimony, allowing people to be punished severely for even low-level crimes.</p>
            <p>At the back end are release policies that affect people already in prison and how long they&rsquo;ll stay. Many states increased the minimum amount of a sentence people must serve and removed or restricted release options like parole. By erasing opportunities to earn an earlier release, these policies removed incentives for people to undergo the transformative personal growth that prevents reoffending.</p>

              States began to impose disproportionately long sentences.
            </div>

            <p>Policymakers pursued their tough-on-crime agenda by enacting laws&mdash;many still on the books today&mdash; that handed down long sentences for a wide range of offenses. Some states changed their laws to make offenses eligible for prison time that had previously been punished with community supervision. Others changed sentencing thresholds to <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/RDL_doc_2006.pdf" target="_blank">lower the quantity of drugs</a> or value of stolen property required to trigger longer sentences.</p>
            <p>Often, the sentences allowed under these new laws were disproportionately long compared to the severity of the crime. In some states, broad sentencing ranges put into effect for certain offenses gave judges considerable freedom to hand out harsh punishments. In Utah, for instance, first-degree felonies now carry a minimum sentence of 5 years with <a href="https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter3/76-3-S203.html?v=C76-3-S203_1800010118000101" target="_blank">a maximum of life</a>. In Louisiana, the penalty for armed robbery ranges <a href="http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=78597" target="_blank">from 5 to 99 years</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5085&context=mulr" target="_blank">Experts suggest</a> that longer sentences became the norm for all types of offenses partly because of a growing acceptance of severe sentences for the most serious crimes. These sentences have set an unprecedented standard of punishment in the modern era and normalized harsh penalties for other offenses.

            Popular &ldquo;bumper-sticker&rdquo; crime policies increased time served for certain crimes.            
            </div>
            <p>Certain crimes or circumstances can automatically trigger mandatory sentence increases (for example, if an offense is gang-related or committed near a school). These rules can require judges to hand out a longer sentence even if they don&rsquo;t think one is warranted. Further, these sentencing enhancements tend to disproportionately affect communities of color, <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/docUploads/SchoolZonesReport06.pdf" target="_blank">exacerbating racial disparities</a>.
            </p>

Simply pulling out a gun could earn someone 10 years; firing it, <a href="http://famm.org/marissa-alexander/" target="_blank">even as a warning shot</a>, could earn them 20.

              <p>Even though the number of people sentenced each year under this enhancement stayed fairly steady, the total number of people in prison serving 10-20-Life sentences skyrocketed because so few are released each year. As new people enter, this group continues to stack up.</p>

The public, convinced that dangerous people were cycling in and out of prison, embraced these laws despite a lack of evidence that they would help reduce crime.</p>
            <div class="center-case-study-div">
              <div class="case-study-header">Case study: <span class="case-study-state">California</span></div>
              <p>Though it was not the first state to adopt such a policy, California&rsquo;s notorious Three Strikes law stands out as one of the most extreme examples. Enacted in 1994, <a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/20142.htm" target="_blank">the law</a> doubled the penalty for a second felony if the first was violent and triggered a sentence of 25 years to life for any third felony, even petty theft.</p>
              <p>A 2012 ballot initiative (Proposition 36) reformed the law to prevent less serious crimes from triggering a third-strike life sentence and included a retroactivity clause that allowed more than 3,000 people in California prisons to petition for <a href="http://www.naacpldf.org/files/publications/ThreeStrikesReport_v6.pdf" target="_blank">reduced sentences</a>. It did not, however, reform the law for people with more serious third-strike offenses, including some drug crimes, nor did it change the second-strike provision.</p>
              <p>Today, &ldquo;second strikers&rdquo; continue to receive long sentences. Even as reforms to reduce overcrowding caused California&rsquo;s total prison population to drop by 25 percent from 2006 to 2016, the number of people serving a second-strike sentence <a href="http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Quarterly/Strike1Archive.html" target="_blank">has held steady.</a></p>
              <p>These mandatory sentencing laws have caused a major shift in the makeup of California&rsquo;s prison population. In 2006, a fifth had been sentenced for a second strike. Today, second strikers make up a full quarter of the state&rsquo;s prison population.</p>

            <p>Historically, people in prison could get time off their sentences by maintaining clean disciplinary records or participating in programs. Parole boards traditionally weighed these factors and other signs of personal transformation when deciding who to release. Early release credits were so integral to state sentencing structures that judges made sentencing decisions knowing that people could earn time off.</p>
            <p>A wave of legislation in the 1980s and &rsquo;90s, however, limited or eliminated these &ldquo;good time&rdquo; or &ldquo;earned time&rdquo; credits. Many states adopted determinate sentencing structures and truth-in-sentencing laws that required people to serve a set percentage of their minimum sentence, regardless of their behavior in prison. In these states, the amount of time people spent in prison was dictated at the moment of sentencing, leaving little flexibility to account for a person&rsquo;s personal growth over the years spent in prison. By the turn of the century, <a href="http://www.urban.org/research/publication/influences-truth-sentencing-reforms-changes-states-sentencing-practices-and-prison-populations" target="_blank">41 states and the District of Columbia</a> had adopted some form of truth-in-sentencing law.</p>

The 1998 law barred people convicted of certain serious offenses from earning credits to reduce their time served. By 2000, that rule applied to everyone entering Michigan prisons.</p>
              <p>These changes drove up the time served by people who might otherwise have earned credits for good conduct. Michigan&rsquo;s stringent release policies have helped make it one of the states with the longest average time served.</p>

            <p>Even the opportunity to appear before a parole board for consideration became less likely, as statutory changes in some states made people wait longer for their next hearing after being denied. As the size and makeup of parole boards changed, so did the prospects for parole-eligible people to have their cases heard. Because most board members are <a href="http://www.apaintl.org/resources/documents/surveys/2008.pdf" target="_blank">selected by state governors and legislatures</a>, the composition and behavior of a board can shift quickly based on state politics, leading to sudden and marked changes in parole rates that have nothing to do with the people being considered for parole.</p>

              <p>Michigan&rsquo;s recent history demonstrates just how dramatically parole practices can fluctuate in response to political decisions. In 1992, the state overhauled its parole system and changed the makeup of its board from civil servants to political appointees. In just five years, <a href="http://www.capps-mi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Five-years-after-An-analysis-of-the-parole-board-since-1992.pdf" target="_blank">parole approvals dropped by 10 percent</a> and the number of people who stayed in prison longer than their court-imposed sentence nearly doubled.</p>
              <p>In 2009, Governor Jennifer Granholm signed an executive order expanding the parole board to increase its capacity to review cases that were being continually deferred. Within the year, the number of <a href="http://2015capps.capps-mi.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CAPPS-report-10000-fewer-prisoners.pdf" target="_blank">paroles granted skyrocketed</a>. When Governor Rick Snyder took office in 2011, he <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/corrections/0,4551,7-119-1435_11601-331908--,00.html" target="_blank">reinstated the former parole board</a>.</p>

            <p>Parole policies and practices are often extremely reactive, responding quickly to incidents that grab the public&rsquo;s attention. High-profile crimes committed by people on parole raise the perceived political stakes of granting parole to others. Risk-averse parole boards may simply prefer not to grant parole rather than take a chance that someone they release will reoffend.</p>

              <p>Pennsylvania&rsquo;s decline in commutations for life-sentenced people in the 1990s was <a href="http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/philadelphia/98457-stepping-back-from-vengeance-seeking-reformative-justice" target="_blank">prompted</a> in part by headline-grabbing crimes committed by one person released on parole. In Arkansas, <a href="http://csgjusticecenter.org/jr/arkansas/media-clips/a-reform-wrinkle/" target="_blank">similar circumstances</a> led to a <a href="http://www.arktimes.com/general/files/jfareport.pdf" target="_blank">sharp rise</a> in parole revocations and a <a href="http://www.texaspolicy.com/press_release/detail/arkansass-prison-population-and-related-expense-is-exploding" target="_blank">spike in the prison population</a>.</p>
              <p>In some cases, states have avoided these consequences by taking a more measured response to such incidents. Although Pennsylvania initially responded to a murder in 2008 by <a href="http://www.budget.pa.gov/PublicationsAndReports/Documents/2008-09%20Gov%20Performance%20Report%20-%20Public%20Safety.pdf" target="_blank">instating a moratorium on parole</a>, it conducted a study of its parole policies and determined that they were still largely safe and effective. Pennsylvania reinstated parole the next year. During the brief moratorium, the state&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2009/apr/15/pennsylvania-prison-crowding-parole-crisis-result-in-new-laws-parole-suspension/" target="_blank">prison population swelled</a>.</p>

            <p>The number of people serving life sentences has <a href="http://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Life-Goes-On.pdf" target="_blank">more than quadrupled</a> since 1984 and has risen most sharply for those with no possibility of parole. As of 2016, <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/still-life-americas-increasing-use-life-long-term-sentences/" target="_blank">one in nine</a> people in prison was serving a life sentence. When virtual life sentences&mdash;those that exceed a person&rsquo;s likely lifespan&mdash;are included, that figure increases to one in seven.</p>
            <p>Before the 1970s, <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/polisci/sites/www.sas.upenn.edu.polisci/files/No%20Way%20Out-Gottschalk.pdf" target="_blank">few served the entirety of a &ldquo;life&rdquo; sentence</a>, and life without parole existed in only seven states. It has since been adopted in every state except Alaska, and parole for life sentences has become <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/delaying-second-chance-declining-prospects-parole-life-sentences/" target="_blank">much less common</a>. And over the past few decades, more and more life sentences have been given to people convicted of crimes other than murder, including <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/111813-lwop-complete-report.pdf" target="_blank">nonviolent offenses</a>.</p>
            <p>This rapid shift reflects a modern sentencing reality that favors indefinite imprisonment over rehabilitation. After the US Supreme Court <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/69-5030" target="_blank">temporarily banned the death penalty</a> in 1972, the popularity of life without parole sentences exploded as states sought <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=609118119089003109089006123083116002032050073078086039018100068073094122119006076070057009021101116003110065081081111064066105009059069023087016027089116019070004034015043026080105097030125127084083124011100111112118004120008113065003127091070026114&EXT=pdf" target="_blank">alternatives to capital punishment</a>.

              <p>No one with a life sentence in Pennsylvania is eligible for parole. As one of the first states to adopt sentences of life without parole, Pennsylvania has the second-largest population serving such sentences in the country. <a href="http://sentencingproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Life-Goes-On.pdf" target="_blank">One in 10 people</a> serving life without parole in a state prison is incarcerated in Pennsylvania.</p>
              <p>Before 1980, Pennsylvania governors often commuted life sentences to 20 years, but this practice <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/the-meaning-of-life-long-prison-sentences-in-context/" target="_blank">has slowed nearly to a halt</a>. In recent decades, the number of people serving sentences longer than 10 years has <a href="http://www.cor.pa.gov/About%20Us/Statistics/Pages/Old-Statistical-Reports.aspx#.WUQ0qhMrLXF" target="_blank">grown twice as quickly</a> as the number of people serving sentences of 10 years or less.
