           In the stories of people who have been incarcerated for much of their lives, the personal costs of long-term incarceration for themselves and their families are palpable.

            <p>As mass incarceration gained momentum, proponents of tough-on-crime policies argued that harsher punishments would ensure public safety and bring healing to victims of crime, particularly crimes of violence. Today, that argument is again echoed in our <span class="blue-text">attorney general’s call for tougher prosecutions and longer sentences</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Yet decades of experience have revealed long prison terms to be a weak antidote to the problems that cause violence, and a <span class="blue-text">painfully inadequate answer to victims’ calls for resolution and healing</span>.</p>

            Long prison terms don’t necessarily help victims heal.
            </div>
            <p>When the man who shot and killed her husband was sentenced to death, Dionne Wilson thought she would be free of the anger and fear that consumed her. Her husband, police officer Dan Niemi, was killed on duty in 2005; two years later, the man who shot Niemi was convicted, but the verdict did little to ease Wilson’s pain.</p>

            <p>“The promise that I would be somehow healed from that didn’t happen, and I kind of spiraled out of control emotionally. I was just a wreck because I was supposed to feel better once he was on death row, and it just didn’t happen that way,” Wilson said. “What I was told about being healed and feeling better and all of these things—it didn’t work. It was a lie.”</p>
            <p>For four-and-a-half years, she struggled, searching for the healing that the conviction didn’t bring. She chased after any diversion that would make her feel better, she said, until she hit a brick wall. Through meditation and Buddhist practice, she found a sense of peace and compassion that led her to forgive the man who killed her husband and rethink her stance on the death penalty.</p>
            <p>Although she once believed that people in prison were just bad people, perhaps irredeemably so, Wilson said her perspective was radically transformed after she visited a women’s prison in Chowchilla, California, through an Insight Prison Project program.</p>
            <p>“It was two of the most intensive, heartbreaking, healing, tear-filled days that I’ve ever experienced in my life,” Wilson said. “When I went in there, I was just sitting with women—with women from all walks of life, all different races, all different backgrounds, levels of income, levels of education. Just women that reminded me of family members, of friends.”</p>
            <p>“That whole mental construct that I had around who was incarcerated began to crumble. As I listened to their story, I thought, ‘Well, that could’ve been me.’”</p>
            <p>Wilson is careful to say that her story is not a prescription for healing, nor is it universal for all crime survivors. People harmed by serious crimes have diverse needs, yet we typically offer them a single “one-size-fits-all” solution: a long prison sentence for the person who committed the harm, with very few opportunities for that person to work toward personal transformation while in prison. While many survivors crave retribution immediately after suffering trauma, not all do—and, over time, victims’ feelings may change, as Wilson’s did. By then, they may not be able to change that outcome.</p>
            <p>Some crime survivors may demand long sentences for those who have harmed them mainly because no alternatives are available. With no other way of seeking justice, survivors know that the person who committed the crime will receive either a long prison sentence or nothing at all.</p>

            <p>Most important, our current system doesn’t ask victims what would serve them best. It fails to seek their input in a meaningful way, instead presuming that harsher punishments will mean more complete healing. But when asked, many people who have experienced the most serious crimes express a desire for restorative measures that might help them heal and prevent the violence they suffered from happening again. A 2016 survey showed that 61 percent of crime victims are in favor of shorter prison sentences and increased investment in crime prevention and rehabilitation.</p>

            <p>Proponents of tough sanctions often frame long prison terms as the only way to hold people accountable for committing serious crimes.

            <p>Accountability requires that people accept responsibility for their actions and commit to never causing that harm again. Yet many people in prison never understand or accept the full scope of the harm they have caused because they are emotionally and physically separated from the consequences their behavior has for others. Few are given the opportunity to speak directly to the survivors of their crimes; in fact, this contact is often expressly prohibited. Our courts and prisons discourage people from discussing their crimes openly, so many spend years in prison without even talking about what they have done. Without this reflection, they may never learn to truly understand and accept their culpability, much less how they might begin to make amends to those they have harmed.

            Long prison terms don’t help people change for the better.
            </div>
            <p>Some assume that long prison terms encourage people to face their pasts, build skills, and achieve the personal awareness they need to transform themselves. Ample evidence, though, suggests that longer prison terms are often inadequate or even counterproductive in motivating people to make positive change in their lives.
            </p>
            <p>When people think that they will be in prison for decades no matter what they do, they may be less motivated to take part in programming that might benefit them and make them better prepared to reenter society. In this sense, shorter prison terms can be a more powerful crime reduction strategy than long ones. By offering opportunities for earlier release, correctional systems can encourage peopleto undertake the hard work of self-improvement and leave prison more skilled and empowered to lead productive lives.</p>
            <p>In many prisons, though, people with the longest sentences are the last in line for programming. Without meaningful opportunities to change, people serving long prison terms are simply warehoused. When they are finally released, they often find themselves ill-equipped to navigate the world outside prison.</p>

            <p>Despite this, prisons are rarely equipped to assist people with the trauma they have experienced. On the contrary, the prison environment often compounds this trauma and interferes with recovery.</p>
            <p>Although many assume that long prison terms help deter crime, extensive evidence shows that the severity of punishment is not the key to changing people’s behavior. Long-term incarceration serves only to punish past harm—not prevent new harm. Communities devastated by violence deserve solutions that truly work.</p>

            <div class="left-col-header"><!--HEADLINE 5-->
              Long prison terms contribute to the problem of mass incarceration and the ballooning costs of prison.
            </div>
            <p>That mass incarceration is a growing, costly, and dangerous problem is something that policymakers on both sides of the aisle have recognized. But we can’t reverse mass incarceration without scaling back long prison terms—which will mean taking on the hard work of changing how we respond to violence and those who commit serious crimes.</p>
            <p>Alabama offers evidence that sending fewer people to prison or cutting time served for less serious offenses is not enough to end mass incarceration.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Alabama has seen a decline in the number of people serving shorter prison terms. But while the share of the state’s prison population serving shorter terms has dropped, the share serving long terms has steadily climbed. Even though fewer people are being admitted to Alabama prisons, the size of the state’s prison population has stayed fairly flat as those serving long prison terms remain behind bars.</p>
            <p>Reformers looking to make meaningful reductions in the prison population must not stop at reforms for low-level offenses. They will need to address this “stacking effect” and make more ambitious changes to bend the curve.</p>
            <div class="graph-container">
            </div>
            <p>In addition, it is disproportionately expensive to house people serving long prison terms.</p>
            <p>As of the most recent year of data available for each state, everyone incarcerated had spent a combined total of 5,898,950 years in prison. People who had served the longest 10 percent of prison terms had served 42 percent of that time, or 2,471,085 years—accounting for nearly half of the resources spent so far on the incarcerated population.</p>
            <p>And because people serving the longest prison terms tend to be older than the rest of the prison population, they likely incur additional costs for healthcare—a dimension that our analysis does not capture.</p>
            <p>Long-term incarceration fails to effectively hold people accountable for harms, adequately address victims’ needs, motivate people to make positive change in their lives, or even deter crime. Instead of lengthening prison terms, we must develop more fair and effective responses to serious crime.</p>

            TRUE REFORM WILL REQUIRE US TO RETHINK OUR RELIANCE ON LONG-TERM INCARCERATION
            </div>
            <p>Addressing long-term incarceration means grappling with the fact that 9 in 10 people serving the longest prison terms are convicted of a violent offense. Policy conversations about justice reform often focus on nonviolent crimes, but these offenses make up a minority of those serving the longest prison terms. While most people convicted of drug and property offenses leave prison within a few years, those convicted of violence remain in prison. For example, of the people who entered prison in 2000 in states that provided data that year, <b>84 percent of those still incarcerated 14 years later were there for a violent offense.</b>
            </p> 
            <div class="graph-container">
            </div>
            <p>There has been a growing commitment to invest in alternatives to incarceration for low-level crimes, like drug courts, mental health courts, and other problem-solving courts that address the underlying causes of crime. The juvenile justice system has also demonstrated remarkable success in diverting many young people from detention without compromising public safety. Yet there has been little investment in alternatives to incarceration for adults who commit serious offenses.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, people with serious criminal histories are often ineligible to participate in alternative courts and restorative programs, despite evidence that these alternatives work just as well, if not better, for people who have committed serious crimes. Instead, even as states introduce reforms to divert people with low-level convictions from prison, many maintain—or even raise—the penalties imposed upon those convicted of violence. Since 2000, time served in prison has risen faster than average for those convicted of a violent crime—and fastest for those convicted of homicide.</p>
            <p>For the past 50 years, many lawmakers have asserted their commitment to curbing violence by reactively inflicting increasingly harsh penalties on people who commit violent offenses. At the same time, many have failed to invest in strategies shown to proactively stop violence from occurring in the first place. Cities like Chicago that have soaring rates of violent crime continue to cut funding for proven violence prevention programs like CeaseFire.</p>

            <p>Our research and our conversations with people who have served long prison terms, survivors of violent crime, policy experts, and practitioners have led us to a set of core principles that we believe should guide decisionmaking:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="spacing"><b>Sentences should be proportionate to the offense and the circumstances surrounding it.</b> While our justice system must be consistent and fair for people who commit similar crimes under similar circumstances, “one-size-fits-all” approaches too often encourage excessive punishment. Decisionmakers should take individual characteristics and unique circumstances into account when charging and sentencing people.</li>
              <li class="spacing"><b>Punishments should be no more severe than necessary to achieve safety and healing.</b> Instead of defaulting to the harshest possible punishment, longer prison terms should be imposed only when justified with evidence. Decisionmakers should prioritize solutions that encourage rehabilitation and reduce recidivism.</li>
              <li class="spacing"><b>Victims must be offered more than one way of seeking justice.</b> Our justice system should empower victims of crime by providing them with meaningful avenues for voicing their needs. We must also invest in other responses to violent crime besides long-term incarceration that prioritize survivors’ well-being by promoting true accountability and reducing recidivism.</li>

Those who demonstrate significant progress while in prison should be given an opportunity for review and release.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>Guided by these principles, we recommend the following changes to policy and practice:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="spacing"><b>Allow for individualized sentencing and release decisions.</b> This means repealing mandatory minimums and requirements that people serve a set percentage of their sentences regardless of demonstrated personal progress while incarcerated.</li>
              <li class="spacing"><b>Introduce or expand opportunities and incentives to earn earlier release.</b> In states with parole, policymakers should review eligibility requirements and parole decisionmaking protocols to assess whether these practices give people opportunities to take advantage of life-changing programming. In states lacking a parole release provision, the Model Penal Code has recommended a “Second Look” provision that would allow a court to review an application for resentencing. This introduces new flexibility into determinate systems, allowing decisionmakers to belatedly take individual circumstances into account when deciding the appropriate level of punishment. Policymakers can also expand options for people to earn time off of their sentencefor program participation and rules compliance. To address the unique needs of women serving long sentences, prisons must ensure that the programming they provide is gender-responsive.</li>
              <li class="spacing"><b>Ensure that people who have committed serious crimes have the resources they need to understand their own behavior and become truly accountable for their past actions.</b> Therapy should be made available to people in prison who have experienced trauma. People with similar life experiences should be encouraged to mentor and learn from one another. Promising programs like the Osborne Association’s Long-Termers Responsibility Project can help people serving long sentences understand the reasons they offended and the harm they caused, accept responsibility, and make amends. </li>
